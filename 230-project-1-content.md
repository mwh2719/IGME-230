## You have just pulled the largest hesit of the decade! Now you need to escape before the cops catch you!
### Objective
Dodge obstacles and find your way through levels to escape the cops.
### Abilities
* Running
* Jumping
* Sliding/crawling
* Collecting keys to open doors
### Mechanics
* Make your way through the level and collect the key
* Go to the door and get one step closer to escaping
* __But most importantly, don't touch the cop chasing you or it is off to the slammer for you__
### Overview
You will navigate through ten levels of increasing difficulty to escape. The levels will contain platforms to jump on, pitfalls and traps to kill you, a key to open the exit door with, and a cop that will simply follow you through the level. You will have three lives on each level. If you lose all your lives, you will have to go back to the beggining of the game and start all over.
